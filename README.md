This repository tracks the solutions and progress for my USACO training. It is divided based on division difficulty, then algorithm. Note some problems may be placed in divisions
not official to its placement based on difficulty inflation and adjustment. For instance, a very easy Gold problem may be placed into Silver, and similarly a very easy Plat may be
placed into Gold or even silver.
All problem names are in accordance with official USACO file names if they are past USACO problems. If a problem is not a USACO problem, it is named according
to how it is named on usaco.guide. File names are followed with a numerical digit (ex: "maxcross8") to indicate number of attempts/submissions required.
